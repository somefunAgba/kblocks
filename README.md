Easily typeset Control Block Diagrams and Signal Flow Graphs with TikZ/PGF

Desiring to typeset control block diagrams in LaTeX and dissatisfied with
the other LaTeX macro packages that can be found online, I thought: why not write my own macro package for this purpose.
I wish to start with the question, “What is kblocks?” The kblocks macro package is the product of using TikZ/ PGF to
directly typeset beautiful control block diagrams and signal flow graphs in my Masters’ dissertation and papers directly with
LaTeX. Basically, it just defines a number of commands to make drawing control block diagrams using TikZ/ PGF
more structured and easier.
Like all LaTeX packages, TikZ/PGF inherits the steep learning curve, that is, no what you see is
what you get. This macro reduces the length of this learning curve and serves as a frontend, by focusing the graphics theme on control block diagrams only.

Fortunately this documentation as it grows and gets to be improved, will come with a number of
slowly-paced tutorials, which will guide you on creating control block diagrams with the kblocks macro.

My wish is that you find it helpful. Don’t forget to share and like. Please feel free to e-mail me for any improvement or
suggestion with respect to using kblocks and making it useful for researchers and students in the applications and field of
control theory.

Please see the Demo file in this repo.
