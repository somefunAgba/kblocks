## Description
A Macro Package to Easily typeset Control Block Diagrams and Signal Flow Graphs with TikZ/PGF

## Statement of Need
Desiring to typeset control block diagrams in LaTeX and dissatisfied 
with the other LaTeX macro packages that can be found online, 
I thought: why not write my own macro package for this purpose. 

Like all LaTeX packages, TikZ/PGF inherits the steep learning curve, that is, 
no what you see is what you get. 
Basically, kblocks defines a number of macro commands to make drawing control block diagrams 
using TikZ/ PGF more structured and easier. 
This macro reduces the length of this learning curve and serves as a frontend, 
by focusing the theme on control block diagrams only.

## Getting Started
You will find a demo and an introduction in kblocks-doc.pdf file. 

Fortunately this documentation in kblocks-doc.pdf as it grows and gets to be improved, 
will come with a number of slowly-paced tutorials, which will guide you 
on creating control block diagrams with the kblocks macro.

## Licensing
Licensing of this package is covered by the MIT Licence.

## Issues and Feedback
My wish is that you find it helpful. Don’t forget to share and like. 
Please feel free to e-mail me for any improvement or suggestion with respect to 
using kblocks and making it useful for researchers, students and others involved
in the applications and field of control theory.
